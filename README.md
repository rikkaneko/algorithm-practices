# Background
I am a student currently self studying CS stuff since I am not able to transfer my study to Computer Science.  
I am learning data structures and algorithms using the online lectures from Princeton University. [[this](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/)]  
**_Please leave me your advice and suggestions if you find my code has problems or bad practice :D_**
